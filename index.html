<div id="intro" class="fullwide"><p>Barnabas came into my life while I was still living in Texas after my old boss acquired an agricultural property (he preferred we not say he "bought a farm" as it sounded too close to buying <em>the</em> farm) and his wife decided they needed a barn cat. Barney, as he was then named, quickly discovered that house life was better than barn life, and Tom pointed out to his wife that this was not the original agreement and she needed to find Barney a home.</p>
    <p>I had recently lost my older cat (cancer sucks) and so Patty began a campaign that culminated in my adopting Barney, but changing his name to Barnabas because I did not want my cat to be associated with either the Flintstones or a certain purple dinosaur.</p>
    <p class="popquote">Barnabas was originally a barn cat, but preferred to be an indoors-snuggling-humans cat.</p>
      <p>The original adjustment was difficult. At the farm Barnabas had been used to going inside and outside at will and hanging out with the dogs. Now he was living in an apartment in the city. (I tried taking him outside on a leash; his resistance to wearing a harness was fierce and I eventually abandoned the idea.) But with patience and a whole lot of sprinting inside the condo chasing a laser pointer with tigrish ferocity, he became accustomed to his new environment.</p></div>

<div class="fullwide">
    <p>He also eventually worked out an accomodation with Murple (short for Murphy's Law, because what else would you name a black cat adopted on Friday the 13th?), my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_cat" target="_blank">Bombay</a> cat of blessed memory. She was about two thirds of his weight and was absolutely the boss of him. His playful energy was a lot for an older cat to handle, but as long as I helped burn some of it off with the laser pointer they got along fine. The shared enmity of panther and tiger for the evil Shoelace of Doom played itself out on dozens of evenings until my arm was too tired to keep up my end of the bargain.</p>
    <p>Besides laser- and shoelace-battling ferocity, his primary hobby is chewing on things, to the point that for a while I wondered if he were teething. (Nowadays I just tell people his religion is Orthodox Chewish.) He doesn't usually swallow inappropriate objects (although a swallowed shoelace once led him to receive an abdominal ultrasound; no surgery was necessary) but will cheerfully shred carboard boxes and personal papers, and on one notable occasion he chewed a one-inch square out of the seat of a pair of blue jeans; that was when my vet pronounced him a goat cat.</p>

</div>
    <p>Along with an affinity for chewing things, his other dog-like trait is the degree to which he's attached to me. He certainly likes my wife and stepkids fine, but when I leave the room he'll follow me and if I try to shut him in another room with my wife so I can work on a class project he'll ignore her and sit by the door waiting for me to return.</p>
    <p>Road trips with cats are never easy, especially the 1300-mile <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Dallas,+TX/Calumet,+Calumet+Township,+MI/@41.7788583,-97.3652661,6.29z/data=!4m19!4m18!1m10!1m1!1s0x864c19f77b45974b:0xb9ec9ba4f647678f!2m2!1d-96.7969879!2d32.7766642!3m4!1m2!1d-92.1405065!2d46.7734589!3s0x52ae4d0c5739cff1:0xbf688068a4ec38c!1m5!1m1!1s0x4d50bb83d59a5017:0xf905f183146fe27b!2m2!1d-88.454006!2d47.2465922!3e0" target="_blank">drive</a> from Dallas, Texas to Upper Peninsula Michigan. But even by cat standards, Barnabas is an exceptionally bad traveler. My first road trip with him, I'd planned to keep to my usual schedule: leave Dallas after work, drive for about five hours, and spend the night in Kansas before proceeding to Duluth the next day. But Barnabas complained so much that I finally gave up and spent the night in Oklahoma, getting a cheap motel room for myself while the cats slept in the car. The next day Barnabas was a perfect angel all trip; I think he was afraid he was going to be a permanent Oklahoma resident and like every Texan he saw that as a fate worse than death!</p>
    <p>When I moved to Oregon, I consulted with my veterinarian and got the cats some pharmaceutical asisstance to make the trip easier on them. As the left-hand picture demonstrates, it worked pretty well for him.</p>
    <p> I came to Oregon as a single man, but earlier this year I married and moved in with my wife. She has two cats of her own; Mittens quickly achieved mutual toleration with Barnabas, but Oreo hates him with the white-hot fury of a thousand suns. Barnabas is completely indifferent to her hatred, which amuses all the humans in the household but just enrages her more.</p>
    <p>One of Barnabas' many charming attributes is his voice: despite being a full-grown cat (and a tiger in his own mind), he still has the tiny voice of a kitten. My wife compares him to Bubbles from the Powerpuff Girls, specifically in <a href="https://youtu.be/3ekLCcqmvvk" target="_blank">this clip,</a> and BarnaBubbles is one of his many nicknames (along with Barnacle when he's feeling clingy, Barnabarian when he's extra fierce, and occasionally on his worst days Barnabastard).</p>
    <p id="finalgraf">The move from a condo in the city to a townhome in the suburbs also introduced Barnabas to a long-forgotten concept: a lawn. He is an indoor cat, but is sometimes permitted to sit in the front lawn with me, where he will eat grass, dream of committing mayhem against birds and squirrels, and watch the neighbors. It's a good life, for a good cat.</p>
